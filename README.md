This is a project for algorithmic lessons in ZSŁ

## About

This is a simple 2D RPG game in Unity. You move as a player and you can fight monsters. There is a shop in a house in the middle (you spawn next to it). To enter you just need to touch the doors. There you can buy some useful items. You can access inventory by pressing "I". There you can see your stats and select items. To fight with enemies you just need to touch them. When fighting enemies you can do one of four things - Attack (uses Weapon and Strength), Magic (uses Weapon and Intelligence), Item (Heals using Accessory) and Run (You might escape). After defeating an enemy you gain EXP and Gold. Gold is used in shop and EXP let's you level up. Levels automatically boost your stats. There are two bosses - Gardener guarding a chest with loot and a Fallen Night who is the main boss. To interact with a chest just click "E" when standing near one (one chest is hidden).
